# Duplicate File Finder with Reports

This project identifies duplicate files in a specified directory and its subdirectories based on their MD5 hash, moves the duplicates to a separate folder, and generates detailed reports on the duplicate files.

## Features

- **Identify Duplicate Files**: Scans a directory and its subdirectories for duplicate files using MD5 hashing.
- **Move Duplicates**: Automatically moves identified duplicates to a specified folder.
- **Log Generation**: Logs the original and duplicate file paths along with their destination after moving.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Uses [Gooey](https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey) to provide a user-friendly GUI for selecting directories.
- **Report Generation**:
  - Bar graph showing the number of duplicates based on file extensions.
  - Bar graph showing the number of duplicates by folder name and file extension.
  - Line graphs displaying the number of files by creation and modification dates.

## Executable Version

An executable version of this script, named `find_duplicates.exe`, is available for users who do not wish to install Python. The executable allows you to run the program directly without any additional setup.

### Using the Executable

1. Download the executable file from the [Releases](https://github.com/your-username/duplicate-file-finder/releases) section.
2. Run the `find_duplicates.exe` file.
3. A graphical interface will open where you can:
   - Select the directory to search for duplicate files.
   - Select the folder where duplicates should be moved.
4. After the program completes, you will see:
   - A log file (`duplicate_log.txt`) showing details of the duplicates and their movements.
   - Several reports generated as PNG images, showing analysis on the duplicate files found.

### Reports Generated by the Program:

- `duplicates_by_extension.png`: Bar graph showing the number of duplicates by file extension.
- `duplicates_by_folder_extension.png`: Bar graph showing the number of duplicates by folder and extension.
- `files_by_created_date.png`: Line graph showing the number of files by creation date.
- `files_by_modified_date.png`: Line graph showing the number of files by modification date.

## Python Version

If you prefer to use the Python version of the script, follow the instructions below.

### Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Required Python libraries:
  - `gooey`
  - `hashlib`
  - `shutil`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`

Install the required libraries via pip:

```bash
pip install gooey pandas matplotlib
```

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/duplicate-file-finder.git
   cd duplicate-file-finder
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can manually install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install gooey pandas matplotlib
   ```

### Usage

To run the Python script with the GUI:

```bash
python find_duplicates_with_reports.py
```

#### Steps:

1. A graphical interface will open, prompting you to:
   - Select the directory you want to search for duplicates.
   - Select (or confirm) the folder where duplicates will be moved.
2. After the duplicates are processed, the script will generate:
   - A log file (`duplicate_log.txt`) with details of the duplicates and their movements.
   - The same reports as described in the **Executable Version** section.

### Command-line Usage

If you prefer to use the command line without the GUI, you can pass the directory paths directly:

```bash
python find_duplicates_with_reports.py --directory /path/to/directory --duplicate_folder /path/to/duplicate/folder
```

## Compiling to an Executable

If you'd like to compile the Python script into your own executable, you can use **PyInstaller**:

1. Install PyInstaller:
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. Run the following command to compile the script:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile --windowed find_duplicates_with_reports.py
   ```

This will create an executable in the `dist` folder named `find_duplicates.exe`.

## Contributing

1. Fork the project.
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add YourFeature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`).
5. Open a pull request.
